3a1
- statement coverage

3c1 - (What is the maximum code coverage you reach when executing your tests?)
    *

3c2 - (Which defects did you find?)
    * cant handle uppercase and lowercase letters in derov()
        - for example derov("PoP") = Pop when it should only contain 1 letter -> P
    * missing consonants in lower_consonants and upper_consonants

3c3 - (How did you correct the defects?)
    * added missing consonants
    * added an extra for-loop in derov() that searches for lowercase o
      in upper_consonants

3c4 - (Do all test cases pass once the defects have been corrected?)
    * yes


4c1 - (How many state transitions (compare 0-switch, 1-switch, etc. mentioned in the lecture) are reasonable to test in this case?)
    * 5  0-switch transition
    * 1  1-switch transitions

4f1 - (How much code coverage do you reach with your tests?)
    * Clock 93%
    * Date 81%
    * Time 81%
    * All classes together = 88%
